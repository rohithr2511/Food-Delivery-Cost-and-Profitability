Let’s proceed with the cost and profitability analysis:
# calculate total costs and revenue per order
food_orders['Total Costs'] = food_orders['Delivery Fee'] + food_orders['Payment Processing Fee'] + food_orders['Discount Amount']
food_orders['Revenue'] = food_orders['Commission Fee']
food_orders['Profit'] = food_orders['Revenue'] - food_orders['Total Costs']

# aggregate data to get overall metrics
total_orders = food_orders.shape[0]
total_revenue = food_orders['Revenue'].sum()
total_costs = food_orders['Total Costs'].sum()
total_profit = food_orders['Profit'].sum()

overall_metrics = {
    "Total Orders": total_orders,
    "Total Revenue": total_revenue,
    "Total Costs": total_costs,
    "Total Profit": total_profit
}

print(overall_metrics)

{'Total Orders': 1000, 'Total Revenue': 126990, 'Total Costs': 232709.85, 'Total Profit': -105719.85}
Based on the analysis, here are the overall metrics for the food delivery operations:

-Total Orders: 1,000
-Total Revenue (from Commission Fees): 126,990 INR
-Total Costs: 232,709.85 INR (including delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discounts)
-Total Profit: -105,719.85 INR
The analysis indicates that the total costs associated with the food delivery operations exceed the total revenue generated from commission fees, resulting in a net loss. It suggests that the current commission rates, delivery fees, and discount strategies might not be sustainable for profitability.

To better understand the distribution of costs, revenue, and profit, let’s plot:

-A histogram of profits per order to visualize the distribution of profitable and unprofitable orders.
-A pie chart to visualize the proportion of total costs (delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discounts).
-A bar chart to compare total revenue, total costs, and total profit
